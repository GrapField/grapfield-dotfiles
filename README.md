# grapfield-dotfiles

dotfiles to be used for my linux installations to have at least somwehat consistent feeling :D all subfolders to be copied to /home/"username"/.config/ if not stated otherwise. 

files not to be synced automatically (at least for me) are to be copied manually for purpose of very different machines and sw setups.


if anything needs to be changed within dotfile, there is file "readme-xxx.md"  xxx being the application. with instructions inside - usually to change path to file according to your username, or with dependencies

feel free to try anything, and/or hit me with some improvements :) enjoy!
